      This is a <a href="{{ appenv.application.host }}" target="_blank" class="type_link">Node.js app</a> running on IBM Bluemix. <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" class="type_link" target="_blank">Node.js</a> code is JavaScript running on the server side. Node.js has a rich collection of add-on libraries that can be baked into your applications using the <a href="https://npmjs.org/" class="type_link">npm</a> package manager. This application uses the <a href="http://expressjs.com/" class="type_link" target="_blank">Express</a> web framework, the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/couchimport" class="type_link" target="_blank" class="type_link">couchimport</a> CSV library and the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloudant" class="type_link" target="_blank">Cloudant Node.js library</a>, amongst others, to power this web app.

      The Simple Search Service converts structured CSV/TSV data files into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" class="type_link" target="_blank">JSON</a> before storing it in <a href="{{ appenv.storage.url }}" target="_blank" class="type_link">IBM Cloudant</a>, running on IBM Bluemix. (If you don't know your Cloudant password, <a href="{{ appenv.application.host }}" target="_blank" class="type_link">access Cloudant through the app</a> on Bluemix instead.). <a href="https://docs.cloudant.com/search.html" class="type_link" target="_blank">Cloudant Search</a>, built using <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/core/" class="type_link" target="_blank">Apache Lucene</a>, indexes the data and provides a query language that allows free-text and fielded searches to be performed to provide paginated, faceted search results.

      By default, searches are cached using an in-memory store within the app. By attaching a <a href="https://www.compose.io/redis/" class="type_link" target="_blank">Redis by Compose</a> database to Simple Search Service, search data is cached in Redis instead. This allows cache data to be shared between multiple Simple Search Service instances, such as deployments made using the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cloud/library/cl-autoscale-app/" class="type_link" target="_blank">Bluemix auto-scaling service</a>.

      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS" class="type_link" target="_blank">CORS</a> stands for <i>Cross Origin Resource Sharing</i>. It describes the process of a web application making a request for data after the page has load (sometimes known as AJAX or XHR requests) from another domain name. If my web page (<a href="http://www.glynnbird.com/" class="type_link" target="_blank">www.glynnbird.com</a>) wanted to fetch JSON data from another domain (e.g. <a href="https://sss-got.mybluemix.net/search?q=jon+snow" class="type_link" target="_blank">sss-got.mybluemix.net/search?q=jon+snow</a>) then browser rules would prevent this because the two domain names differ: this is a <i>Cross-origin</i> request. Fortunately, the Simple Search Service circumvents these restrictions by sending special HTTP headers with each API response to tell the browser that CORS requests are allowed. This makes it very simple for applications on any domain to use the Simple Search Service as a service for client-side API requests.

      By compressing or "zipping up" the search results within the Simple Search Service before sending the data to the browser, we can make savings on the volume of data being transferred between server and client. The smaller the amount of data being transferred, the faster the service - especially in cirumstances where bandwidth is low, such as mobile applications. For instance, <a href="https://sss-got.mybluemix.net/search?q=Lannister&limit=100" class="type_link" target="_blank">this request</a> takes 39k to transfer uncompressed but less than 7k compressed - nearly a 6x saving. Compression is achieved using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/compression" class="type_link" target="_blank">Compression Express module</a>.
